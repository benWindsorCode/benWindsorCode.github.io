My name is Ben Windsor and I'm a Strat working at Goldman Sachs in London. 

### Interests and Skills

I have strong interests in:
- Quantitative finance
- Good development practices
- Mathematics (pure and applied)

While at Goldmans I have worked both in the technology division and as a strat. In tech I gained strong a strong Java and technical grounding, deploying live trading systems to production and working with both the front end and back end of these projects. We used Test Driven Development to drive our projects and I took the lead in the testing of the FIX portion of our trading application. As a Strat I am now learning about the funding business as well as working on more quantitative projects. 

### Academic Background and Research Experience

I completed a Masters of Mathematics (MMath) at the University of Warwick, graduating in the summer of 2018. My dissertation was focused on Group Homology, studying under [Prof. Marco Schlichting](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/marco_schlichting/). You can read my dissertation if curious: [Spectral Sequences and the Homology of Affine Groups](static/Ben_Windsor_Masters_Dissertation.pdf) (PDF warning!). The culmination of this dissertation is a new proof of an important result from a paper by Prof. Schlichting. This result is crucial in Schlichting's determining of the Homology Stability of $SL\_q(A)$, for a ring $A$.

I also worked on two funded summer research projects at my time in warwick, funded by Warwick's [Undergraduate Research Support Scheme](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/skills/urss/):
- The first was with [Prof. Bjorn Stinner](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/bjorn_stinner/), where we applied isogemetric analysis to more efficiently simulate cell motility. In particular this involved using Matlab to implement the isogeonetric analysis simulation, running on some diffusion PDEs coupled with a moving surface which represented the cell membrane.
- The second was with [Prof. Miles Reid](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/Miles.Reid/), where we explored an orbifold version of the Riemann-Roch equation from algebraic geometry.
